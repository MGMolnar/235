Game Overview
=====

It should have been a relaxing weekend with your best friends away from the city, not having to think about work nor
the family. Everything was great, you needed this, it was just that morning when you shot an elevan point deer. You 
thought about your life up until now as you rocked back and forth on the outside rocking chair. It was then the Invasion
started, and when you realize, your family is in danger.

In this top down simulation, you have to dodge and weave through aliens on your way to your family.
Sneaking around is the aim of the game and the keeping a low profile will let you get your family 
to from their house back to safety. Using cars as a way to hide from aliens you can get around the
neighborhood without being seen. Once seen, the aliens will chase and try to attack you. If you can
out chase them, they will go back to what they were doing. Good Luck.

 Documentation

### Website Process

First step was creating the video game idea. This included coming up with the theme and general gameplay for the game.
The next step was to create the theme of the website. This included layout, color scheme and images used. 
Finally, I set out to create the website, creating all four pages: main page, project page, proposal page, and documentation page.
To create the color scheme I used coolers.co and with the theme of an alien invasion I tried to keep the color scheme to grays, blacks, and green.
For the images I used photoshop and drew them out, after I had created an idea of what I wanted. After all the content 
was added into the pages, it was time to start making the pages responsive. I went through sliding in and out on each
web page making each as responsive as possible. Afterwards I checked to see how the pages looked on different devices.
If any of the pages did not look right I fixed them to be responsive to the different device sizes.
