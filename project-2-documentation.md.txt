### Website Process

First step to creating this website was what I wanted to be displayed and figure out who I wanted to look at this website.
I decided that I wanted to display the Magic The Gathering, MTG for short, cards as if this was a database. Now that I
what I wanted to display, I went to decide who this website would be for. I settled on normal MTG players would visit
this site and that would be my specific audience. Even with that in mind I still wanted to try and keep my website
as professional as possible with using a minimal color selection and a nicely laid out format. I wanted to keep the 
attention on the cards at all cost as that is what the people are coming to look at. I then went to work with the API
and decided that I wanted to display the cards name, an image of the card, and the set that the card was from. I also
chose on the fields that the user could change which became the color of the card, the converted mana cost, or cmc for short,
of the card, and the amount of cards that would be on a single page. The next thing I added in was changing pages which came
at a cost. Since I had chosen to let people set the number of cards per page, that meant not all the cards from one of the
API pages would be displayed on screen at the same time. So I needed a way to loop through the results of one API page number
then when I got to the end increase the API page number by one. In the end I was able to do this which took me awhile to do.
My last thing I ended up adding in was the local storage to the browser. I created two buttons one that would save the
current page the user was on and another that would then load that same page. This allowed the user to leave the page 
then come back and load back to the same page.

### Anything Special

I believe that the way I go through each page is something special to my work. I do not believe many people
using this same API would let the user set how many cards they want to see per page. Since other websites won't
have this selection, their changing of each page is much simpler. They will display the full amount of the array 
for one API page which is about 175 objects. Now for me if the user chooses to see only 10 of those objects per
page, I have to go through the next 165 objects. So I needed to code a way to get through the array then check 
once I hit the end to up the API page count which would then show create a new array of 175 objects. Also it is not
documented anywhere but if the user clicks on one of the images a new tab will pop up with a higher resolution image.

### Grade

I believe I deserve an A for this project. The reason for this is I feel my websites functionality is really well
created for only a group of one. I do believe I deserve to lose some points for design as I felt my selection fields
were off and should have been designed differently, but I ran out of time.
